# What are the advanced types in TypeScript?
- Advanced types in TypeScript include:
- **Intersection Types**: Combine multiple types into one.
- **Union Types**: Allow a variable to be one of several types.
- **Literal Types**: Define specific values a variable can take.
- **Mapped Types**: Create new types by transforming existing ones.
- **Conditional Types**: Define types based on conditions.
- **Template Literal Types**: Create types using string templates.
- **Utility Types**: Predefined types like `Partial`, `Readonly`, and `Record`.
- **Type Guards**: Functions that narrow down types at runtime.
- **Generics**: Allow functions and classes to work with any type while maintaining type safety.
- **Type Aliases**: Create custom names for types.
- **Interfaces**: Define the structure of objects and classes.
- **Type Inference**: TypeScript automatically infers types based on the assigned values.
- **Type Assertions**: Explicitly specify a type for a value.
