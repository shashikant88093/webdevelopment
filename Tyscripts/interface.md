# What is interface in TypeScript?
- Interface in TypeScript is a way to define the structure of an object, specifying the properties and their types. It allows for type-checking and ensures that objects conform to a specific shape.
- It can be used to define contracts for classes, ensuring they implement certain methods and properties.
- Interfaces can extend other interfaces, allowing for more complex type definitions.
