# What is generics in TypeScript?
- Generics in TypeScript allow you to create reusable components that can work with any data type. They enable you to define functions, classes, and interfaces that can operate on types specified at the time of use, providing flexibility and type safety.
- Generics are defined using angle brackets `<>` and can be applied to functions, classes, and interfaces.
- They help avoid code duplication and improve maintainability by allowing the same code to work with different types without losing type information.
```ts
function identity<T>(arg: T): T {
  return arg;
}
const result = identity<string>("Hello, Generics!");
const numberResult = identity<number>(42);
``` 

- In the example above, `identity` is a generic function that takes a type parameter `T`. It can accept any type and returns the same type, ensuring type safety while allowing flexibility in usage.
