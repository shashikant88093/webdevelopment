# What is web vitals?
- Web Vitals are a set of metrics that measure the **user experience** of a website, focusing on aspects like loading performance, interactivity, and visual stability. They help developers understand how their site performs in real-world conditions.
- These metrics are essential for optimizing user experience and improving search engine rankings.
- Web Vitals are part of Google's initiative to provide a unified way to measure the quality of user experience on the web.
- They are designed to be simple, standardized, and actionable, making it easier for developers to focus on the most important aspects of user experience.
- Web Vitals are not just about speed; they also consider how users perceive the performance of a website, which is crucial for retaining visitors and reducing bounce rates.
- By focusing on these metrics, developers can make informed decisions to enhance the overall user experience, leading to better engagement and satisfaction.
- Web Vitals are continuously evolving to adapt to new web technologies and user expectations, ensuring they remain relevant in measuring user experience.

- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**:  
    Measures how quickly the main content of a page loads. LCP tracks the time it takes for the largest visible element—such as an image, video, or large text block—to appear on the screen.  
    - **Good LCP score:** Under 2.5 seconds.
- **First Input Delay (FID)**: Measures interactivity. It quantifies the time from when a user first interacts with a page (like clicking a button) to when the browser responds. A good FID score is under 100 milliseconds.
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: Measures visual stability. It tracks how much the page layout shifts during loading. A good CLS score is under 0.1.
- **Total Blocking Time (TBT)**: Measures the total time that a page is blocked from responding to user input. It is the sum of all time periods between FID and the time when the main thread is free to respond to user input. A good TBT score is under 200 milliseconds.
- **Time to First Byte (TTFB)**: Measures the time it takes for the browser to receive the first byte of data from the server. A good TTFB score is under 200 milliseconds.
- **Speed Index**: Measures how quickly the contents of a page are visibly populated. It is calculated based on the visual progress of the page loading. A good Speed Index score is under 3 seconds.  
- **First Contentful Paint (FCP)**: Measures the time it takes for the first piece of content (text, image, etc.) to be rendered on the screen. A good FCP score is under 1 second.
- **Time to Interactive (TTI)**: Measures the time it takes for a page to
become fully interactive, meaning all scripts have loaded and the page is responsive to user input. A good TTI score is under 5 seconds.
- **Max Potential First Input Delay (Max FID)**: Measures the maximum potential delay for the first input event. It helps identify the worst-case scenario for user interaction delays. A good Max FID score is under 300 milliseconds.

# Tools to Measure Web Vitals
- **Google PageSpeed Insights**: Provides detailed reports on web performance, including Web Vitals metrics. It analyzes the content of a web page and generates suggestions to make that page faster.
- **Lighthouse**: An open-source, automated tool for improving the quality of web pages. It audits performance, accessibility, and SEO, and provides insights into Web Vitals.
- **Web Vitals Chrome Extension**: A browser extension that provides real-time feedback on Web Vitals metrics as you browse the web. It helps developers monitor their site's performance directly in the browser.
- **WebPageTest**: A tool that allows you to run performance tests on your website from different locations and devices. It provides detailed metrics, including Web Vitals, and visualizes the loading process.
- **Chrome DevTools**: Built-in developer tools in Chrome that allow you to analyze and debug web pages. The Performance panel provides insights into Web Vitals and helps identify performance bottlenecks.

# Best Practices for Optimizing Web Vitals
- **Optimize Images**: Use modern image formats (like WebP), compress images, and ensure they are appropriately sized for different devices. This helps improve LCP and FCP scores.
- **Minimize JavaScript**: Reduce the amount of JavaScript that runs on page load. Use code splitting, tree shaking, and defer non-essential scripts to improve FID and TTI scores.
- **Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN)**: Distribute your content across multiple servers to reduce latency and improve loading times. This can help improve LCP and TTFB scores.
- **Implement Lazy Loading**: Load images and other resources only when they are needed (e.g., when they come into the viewport). This can improve LCP and CLS scores by reducing the initial load time.
- **Reduce Server Response Times**: Optimize your server's performance by using caching, optimizing database queries, and minimizing server-side processing. This can help improve TTFB and LCP scores.
- **Avoid Layout Shifts**: Use fixed dimensions for images and other elements to prevent layout shifts during loading. This helps improve CLS scores and provides a more stable user experience.
- **Prioritize Critical CSS**: Inline critical CSS for above-the-fold content to ensure it loads quickly. This can improve FCP and LCP scores by reducing render-blocking resources.
- **Monitor and Test Regularly**: Use tools like Google PageSpeed Insights, Lighthouse, and Web Vitals Chrome Extension to regularly monitor your site's performance. Continuously test and optimize based on the feedback from these tools to maintain good Web Vitals scores.
