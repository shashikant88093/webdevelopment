# what is mvc
# MVC stands for Model-View-Controller, a software architectural pattern commonly used in web development

# It separates an application into three interconnected components:
# 1. **Model**: Represents the data and business logic of the application. It handles data retrieval, storage, and manipulation.
# 2. **View**: Represents the user interface of the application. It displays data to the user and sends user input to the controller.
# 3. **Controller**: Acts as an intermediary between the model and the view.
