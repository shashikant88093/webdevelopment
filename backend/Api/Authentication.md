# What are the type of Authentication ?
- No Authentication
- Basic Authentication
- Token Based Authentication
- Api Key Authorization

# What is No Authentication ?
- No Authentication means that the API does not require any authentication to access its resources.
- This is typically used for public APIs where anyone can access the resources without any restrictions.

# What is Basic Authentication ?
- Basic Authentication is a simple authentication scheme built into the HTTP protocol.
- It uses a username and password to authenticate the user.
- The username and password are sent in the HTTP request header as a base64 encoded string.
- This method is not secure as the credentials can be easily decoded.
- It is recommended to use HTTPS to encrypt the communication when using Basic Authentication.
- Example of Basic Authentication:
```http
GET /api/resource HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Authorization: Basic dXNlcm5hbWU6cGFzc3dvcmQ=
```
# What is Token Based Authentication ?
- Token Based Authentication is a more secure way of authenticating users.
- It involves generating a token after the user logs in, which is then used to authenticate subsequent requests.
- The token is usually a JSON Web Token (JWT) that contains user information and is signed by the server.
- The token is sent in the HTTP request header as a Bearer token.   
- Example of Token Based Authentication:
```http
GET /api/resource HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Authorization  

# What is Api Key Authorization ?
- Api Key Authorization is a method of authenticating users using a unique key.
- The API key is a unique identifier that is generated by the server and provided to the user.
- The API key is sent in the HTTP request header or as a query parameter.
- Example of Api Key Authorization:
```http
GET /api/resource?api_key=your_api_key HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
```
Authorization: ApiKey your_api_key
``` 
Bearer your_token
```
http
GET /api/resource HTTP/1.1
Host: example
.com
Authorization
