## üîí About OWASP Top 10

The **OWASP Top 10** is a **standard awareness document** for developers and organizations, widely recognized as a key starting point for ensuring **secure web application development**.

> "It represents a broad consensus about the most critical security risks to web applications."

* **Adopted globally** by development teams and security professionals.
* **First step** in transforming your development culture towards secure coding practices.
* **Promotes actionable awareness** of the most common security issues.

## üîù OWASP Top 10: 2021 Edition

There are **3 new categories**, **4 renamed or re-scoped categories**, and some **consolidation** from the previous edition (2017).

### ü§π A01:2021 ‚Äì Broken Access Control

* **Position Shift**: Moved up from #5
* **Coverage**: Found in **94% of tested apps**
* **Details**: Improper enforcement of user permissions allowing unauthorized access.
* **Example**: URL tampering to access another user's records.

---

### ü§π A02:2021 ‚Äì Cryptographic Failures

* **Previous Name**: Sensitive Data Exposure
* **Focus**: On **failures in cryptography** instead of just symptoms.
* **Impact**: Often leads to **data leaks** or **system compromise**.
* **Example**: Not using HTTPS, weak encryption.

---

### ü§π A03:2021 ‚Äì Injection

* **Position Change**: Slid down to #3
* **Prevalence**: 94% of applications were tested for it
* **Note**: Now includes **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
* **Example**: SQL, NoSQL, OS command injections

---

### ü§π A04:2021 ‚Äì Insecure Design (New!)

* **Focus**: Design-level flaws, not implementation bugs
* **Need**: Emphasis on threat modeling and secure architecture early in SDLC
* **Example**: Missing security controls by design

---

### ü§π A05:2021 ‚Äì Security Misconfiguration

* **Previous Rank**: #6 in 2017
* **Trend**: 90% of apps had some misconfiguration
* **Includes**: XML External Entities (XXE) from older list
* **Example**: Default credentials, unnecessary ports open

---

### ü§π A06:2021 ‚Äì Vulnerable and Outdated Components

* **Previous Name**: Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities
* **Challenge**: Often hard to test and assess
* **Survey Rank**: #2 in community survey
* **Example**: Using unpatched libraries

---

### ü§π A07:2021 ‚Äì Identification and Authentication Failures

* **Previous Name**: Broken Authentication
* **Shift**: Includes more identity-related weaknesses
* **Improvement**: Standard auth frameworks reducing risk
* **Example**: Predictable login tokens, lack of MFA

---

### ü§π A08:2021 ‚Äì Software and Data Integrity Failures (New!)

* **Scope**: Assumptions about software updates and CI/CD without verification
* **High Impact**: Based on CVSS/CVE mapping
* **Merged In**: Insecure Deserialization (from 2017)
* **Example**: Unsigned software update packages

---

### ü§π A09:2021 ‚Äì Security Logging and Monitoring Failures

* **Previous Name**: Insufficient Logging and Monitoring
* **Expanded Scope**: Includes failures in alerting and forensic support
* **Survey Rank**: #3 in community survey
* **Challenge**: Difficult to test, poor CVE representation

---

### ü§π A10:2021 ‚Äì Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) (New!)

* **Added Due To**: Community survey feedback (#1 rank)
* **Incidence**: Lower than others but **high impact potential**
* **Example**: Forcing backend to make HTTP requests internally (e.g., AWS metadata URLs)
